    title: About me
    summary: |
      Hi, I'm Ash! An educator, researcher, and full stack developer with interests in Web technologies and Software Engineering (SE) education. My teaching and 
      research focuses on filling the skills gap between academia and the software industry through authentic assessments which mimic industry relevant
      projects.
    summary_old: |
      An experienced educator and researcher with interests in Software Engineering (SE) and 
      SE education. As an educator, most of the units I teach align
      with web and native development. I aim to ensure that all of my units fill the
      skills gap between academia and industy through ensuring industry relevance with 
      authentic assessments mimicing real world projects. This skills gap is also the 
      focus of my research where I am investigating how we can survey practitioner generated 
      social media (e.g., blogs and tutorials) to provide novel evidence for SE 
      research, and allow early insight into the current and ever-evolving needs of the software 
      industry. This in turn then feeds back into the curricula.

      - role: Software Engineering Lecturer
        time: 2019 - Present
        company: Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK
        details: |
          I am the unit leader for first year Web Development, second year Full Stack Development
           and third year Mobile Computing. I am also the departments employability and placements
            lead and the programme leader for our BSc Software Engineering course.

          **Units taught**:
          - **Web Development**: A gental introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Students create a website for
          their favourite band/musician and interact with a RESTful API to provide the ability to sign up to a
          mailing list.
          - **Full Stack Web Development**: Students are provided with an OpenAPI specification and a series of 
          automated tests (written with Mocha and Chai). In the first half of the assessment they implement the API
          using Node, Express, and SQLite. Then for the second half of the assessment they create the front end 
          using VueJS (see more: [https://github.com/ash-williams/fsd_blog_engine_server](https://github.com/ash-williams/fsd_blog_engine_server))
          - **Mobile Computing**: Students are provided with a backend server which implements an OpenAPI specification.
          They then create a React Native application which interacts with the API. Each year, the assignment API
          mimics an existing social media application (e.g., WhatsApp ([https://github.com/ash-williams/whatsthat](https://github.com/ash-williams/whatsthat))).
          Students are also introduced to scalable architectures and security considerations.
          
          **Responsibilities**:
          - **Programme Leader**: I am responsible for the overall undergraduate Software Engineering course. This 
          includes the overall coherance and delivery of the course, as well as catering to the needs of all 
          students enrolled.
          - **Employability and Placements Lead**: I interface with companies to help them build relationships with 
          students and develop talent pipelines. I created and chair the departments Industry Advisory Board which
          is made up of senior leaders from organisations which regularly recruit our students. The board meets
          twice a year to discuss the curriculum and opportunities for engagement.

          **Other**:
          - Set up a group where students work on projects for social good. Typically applications and websites for 
          charities and non-profit organisations.
          - Personal tutoring, mentorship, and project supervision for undergraduate and postgraduate students.
          - Consulted on, and co-developed projects to design extra-curricular courses aimed at plugging the digital 
          skills gap.
